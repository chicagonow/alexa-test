Dave Specter, Tad Robinson, Ken Saydak and surprise guests.\nDelmark Records, the internationally renowned, Chicago-based blues and jazz record label is the oldest active record company still owned and operated by its founder. Bob Koester is 85 years young and Delmark is celebrating its 65th anniversary this year with special anniversary recording projects and live shows.\nBob would sometimes refer to Delmark as \u201cthe house that Junior built\u201d. Junior Wells\u2019 Hoodoo Man Blues (1965) is still the biggest selling album on the label and is considered one of the greatest blues albums ever recorded. Delmark is also a jazz label and has more jazz albums in its catalog than blues; however, it\u2019s been the blues that has ensured Delmark\u2019s continued existence. Bob Koester, 20 then, started Delmark in St. Louis in 1953 recording the Windy City Six, a traditional jazz band. A transplant from Wichita, KS Bob learned the whereabouts of forgotten blues musicians from the 1920s and \u201830s living in St. Louis including Speckled Red and Big Joe Williams. Bob joked that Big Joe was pretty good at sniffing out a record deal. Sure enough, after Speckled Red\u2019s The Dirty Dozens came out as Delmar 601 Big Joe was he second blues artist to have a Delmark LP.\nSoon afterwards Bob moved to Chicago for a record label purchase that never happened, but it led to the beginning of his retail operation Jazz Record Mart and put Delmark in the city with the most blues activity. After recording Sleepy John Estes, Curtis Jones and one more Big Joe session, Hoodoo Man Blues (Delmark 612) was the first electric blues album to be recorded on Delmark. Buddy Guy was thought to be under contract to Chess, so he was billed as Friendly Chap for the first 7,000 copies. Bob saw many blues artists on Chicago\u2019s west and south side in neighborhoods to which white people generally did not go. Bob became known for taking young white blues fans into these clubs. Magic Sam, J.B. Hutto, Otis Rush, Carey Bell, Jimmy Dawkins, Luther Allison, Mighty Joe Young, Robert Jr. Lockwood, Roosevelt Sykes and Jimmy Johnson all recorded for Delmark from the late \u201860s through the \u201870s, an impressive legacy.\nDelmark ramped up its recording program big time in 1992 with the purchase of its own recording equipment. Since then the number of blues albums in the catalog has grown from 50 to 250. All of the artists performing on the SPACE show have recorded for Delmark recently. Steve Freund and Tad Robinson are both members of the Rockwell Avenue Blues Band whose new album Back To Chicago was just released on March 16, 2018. Jimmy Johnson, Dave Specter and Omar Coleman all appear on Tribute, a newly recorded blues celebration of Delmark\u2019s 65th Anniversary officially due out June 15, 2018 however advance copies will be available in time for the SPACE show.\n\n\nFAQs\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\u00a0Unless otherwise indicated, all of our shows are all ages. Please bring a valid ID.\nWhat are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?\u00a0Street parking is free after 6pm Monday through Saturday. Street parking is free on Sunday. SPACE is located one block east of the Dempster Purple Line Stop.\u00a0\nWhat can I bring into the event?\u00a0SPACE has a full bar with an exciting array of cocktails and an extensive beer list. While we do not serve food in our venue, customers are welcome to bring in pizza from\u00a0Union, the restaurant up front.

            "text": "Seven-time BMA nominated Tad Robinson grew up in New York City surrounded by music. His initial inspiration came when, as a boy, he heard James Cotton perform in Central Park.

If you have waited for an extended period of time and the food has not been replenished, please contact venue management at the event for an estimated time that the food will be ready for you.

If you have waited for an extended period of time and the food has not been replenished, please contact venue management at the event for an estimated time that the food will be ready for you.

            "text": "17 AND OLDER$12 (General Admission)8pm DOORS9pm SHOWBlues Fest kickoff with the legendary John Primer!As the title of his critically acclaimed Atlantic Records CD suggests, two time Grammy Award Nominee and 2016 Blues Music Award Winner, John Primer is truly \u201cThe Real Deal.\u201d At eight years old, John borrowed his first guitar and started to strum. Before that he played a homemade guitar built on the wall of the house with a broom wire, two nails, and two rocks to make it tight. With the sounds of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Little Milton, Elmore James, BB & Albert King reverberating through his Grandmother Laura Nell\u2019s tube radio, John was instantly hooked. Early inspiration came from his family steeped in spiritual, gospel, blues and R&B tradition. As a young boy, John\u2019s mother knew he would be a singer, \u201che came out singing\u201d she would say. John first appeared on stage at the local Baptist church in his hometown of Camden Mississippi.At the age of eighteen, feeling restless and in search of further audiences, John followed the path of his mentors and migrated to Chicago in the fall of 1963. He quickly found work in an era when Chicago\u2019s modern electric Blues sounds were first taking shape. Forming his first band, The Maintainers in 1964, John and his old Harmony guitar rocked such West Side clubs as, The Place, The Bow Tie, and Lover\u2019s Lounge. By 1968 John had left The Maintainers when the opportunity arose to front the Soul and R&B group The Brotherhood. Jamming late into the night and practicing by day, John was forming his own unique style and expanding his repertoire. John\u2019s success would lead him in 1974 to replace John Watkins in the house band at the world famous Theresa\u2019s Lounge on the South Side of Chicago. Over the course of the next 7 years, John would play with such originators as Sammy Lawhorn, Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, and Magic Slim, all innovators sculpting the sound of Chicago Blues.It was during this point in John\u2019s career quite a few people were taking note of this outstanding performer. In 1979, master songwriter and bassist Willie Dixon persuaded him to join his band The Chicago All Stars. Traveling through the US, Mexico and Europe, John developed his skills as a rhythm guitarist, a lead slide player, and a powerful singer. Another blues master who believed in John Primer was none other than the \u201cHoochie Coochie Man\u201d himself, Muddy Waters. Muddy recruited John not only as a guitarist, but also as an opening act and bandleader. As he did with so many other great musicians, Muddy served as a father to John, instilling in him an unrelenting passion for the music that gave birth to Rock and Roll. John stayed loyal to Muddy until his untimely death in 1983.Fresh off the heels of his success with the Muddy Waters Band, John signed on with the legendary Magic Slim. For the next fourteen years, he toured with Magic Slim & The Teardrops, bringing tight, house rocking sounds to every corner of the planet. While John was the bandleader of Magic Slim & The Teardrops, they were voted the best blues band in the world year after year and are still today thought of as the inventors of \u201cthe lump\u201d, Chicago Blues sound.In 1981 John began playing at the Legendary Checkerboard Lounge on the South-Side of Chicago. He was the house bandleader, holding open jam nights and teaching the next generation how to play the Blues until the original nightclub closed its doors in 2001.But John\u2019s days as a sideman were numbered, and in 1995 the veteran blues man released his major label debut \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d, on Atlantic Records. Deciding to make it out on his own, he began touring extensively in support of his thirteen solo albums to date. John formed his own independent record label, Blues House Productions in 2008 and released \u201cAll Original\u201d his debut CD and then his second CD \u201cBlues On Solid Ground\u201d. John\u2019s first 2 CD\u2019s \u201cAll Original\u201d and Blues On Solid Ground\u201d have been nominated by the National Blues Foundation, the Blues Blast Awards and have won the Living Blues Award as well.John is a Living Legend and is Chicago\u2019s Blues Ambassador, he has been given two Grammy Nominations, two Lifetime Achievement Awards, won a Blues Music Award for Best Traditional Blues Male Artist in 2016 with more than twelve other Blues Music Award nominations, and in 2010 John won the Living Blues Award for Blues Artist of the Year. John is one of the very last Traditional Blues Artists with original Mississippi roots. He was taught by the Founding Father\u2019s of the Blues, the \u201cold way\u201d (some say the \u201cright way\u201d). We need to cherish his history and celebrate his amazing music!",

He began playing Acid House, Disco and the classic Chicago style of his peers at a young age, developing a unique sound that lead him to performances at Chicago\u2019s legendary underground warehouse parties of the 90s, and a residency at the Power House. These formative\u00a0experiences solidified his artistry, launching him into a four year residency in Amsterdam and an eight year residency at Chicago\u2019s infamous Boom Boom Room.In 1994 Gene hit the studio with a driving need for innovation and audio exploration. A self-taught engineer and producer, his work with Cajual, Relief Records, Defected Records, Soma Recordings and his own breakout label Farris Wheel Recordings, propelled his influence into ever expanding realms. He has played venues all over the world and massive festival crowds at Coachella, Outside Lands, Firefly, BPM 2015, and is performing at Movement and WMC events this year.Strongly engaged with his city, he performed Chicago\u2019s Wavefront Festival in 2012 and '2013, hosts \u201cGene Farris & Friends\u201d monthly at Primary, and frequents the booth at Spy Bar. Working closely with fellow Chicago house legend Cajmere, AKA Green Velvet, has resulted in over 15 collaborative singles! O\u2019Darlin from their 2014 Jungle Love EP on Cajual hit number one on TraxSource, with Gene producing 3 additional number one hits that year.

Shortly thereafter he received a full scholarship to University of Illinois at Chicago where he won the prestigious Bar Association Music Award. During this time he also had the opportunity to play in the orchestra for the lost Duke Ellington musical, Jump for Joy. In the 90's he was a part of Chicago's Wicker Park music scene performing regularly with members of Tortoise and Wilco. As a regular studio musician at Gravity Studios he performed on numerous recordings including the Grammy Nominated, self-titled album Studebaker John and the Hawks. More recently, Wes played a tenor sax solo for Phil Collins on a tribute record for his dear friend legendary songwriter, John Martyn. Wes has played with or opened for War, Ziggy Marley, Maceo Parker, Smashing Pumpkins, Guster, 3\u00a0Dog Night, Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel), Adrian Belew, Oz Noy, Dave Weckl, Tony Williams, Umphree\u2019s McGee, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Tributosaurus, Robert Irving and Richard Patterson (Miles Davis), and Rolling Stones sidemen Jack Leavell, Tim Ries and Bernard Fowler (and many more). For five years Wes was owner/operator of the music retail store/school, Musicopia. A competent multi-instrumentalist, Wes performs in various capacities including solo vocal/acoustic, blues trio, and jazz quartet. Some groups he is integral to include ChiNola (Chicago Blues meets New Orleans Funk and Soul), The Improbable Thursays (Experimental Groove/Jazz) as well as his own progressive-rock-meets-singer-songwriter group, WJC. Chicago DJ Richard Milne of WXRT 93.1 once described Wes's music as \"...unlike anything going down in the town.\" Wes has recorded/produced numerous artists over the years including Dave Tamkin, Scottie Long, Typhanie Monique, and Cameron McGill. A capable arranger, he is currently the music director/guitarist/singer/saxophonist for Arlen Music Productions 17 piece orchestra, Evolution. Wes resides in Chicago and continues to write, record, produce and perform hundreds of dates per year.\u00a0\nThroughout his music career Matt Shevitz has performed alongside such internationally renowned musicians as Dick Hyman, Ignacio Berroa, Howard Levy, Frank Capp, Randy Sandke, Ken Peplowski, Byron Stripling, and Frank Wess along with blues/roots rock guitarist Eric Lindell and Ropeadope Records artists Spare Parts. With these artists and others, he has performed at such festivals and clubs as\u00a0the Chicago Jazz Festival, the Chicago Blues Festival, Lollapalooza, the\u00a0Jazz in the Park Festival (in Milwaukee, Wisconsin), the Waterfront Blues Festival (in Portland, Oregon), SPACE (in Evanston, Illinois), \u00a0the House of Blues in Chicago, and as a featured artist for Oregon Festival of American Music (in Eugene, Oregon) and the Modlin Center for the Performing Arts (in Richmond, Virginia).

Kid friendly.\nHere's the lineup...\nBRENT PARKIN\nBrent's music is a mix of Chicago style blues, swing, roots music with some country and roots rock and roll thrown in for good measure. In the last 43 years he co-founded several blues bands including the popular band Houndog in 1976 and been part of backup bands for such legends as Bo Diddley, Gatemouth Brown, Otis Rush, Billy Boy Arnold, Johnnie Johnson, Jimmy T99 Nelson and many more. Brent opened shows for such greats as James Cotton, Johnny Winter, Buddy Guy and John Prine just to name a few and a career highlight is sharing the tour bus and stage with BB King and his band and opening for them on a Western Canadian tour in 1983.\u00a0A few honours have come Brent's way over the years including a\u00a01993 Juno Award for his performance on Saturday Night Blues CBC Compilation, multiple Maple Blues Awards nominations,\u00a02013 & 2014 Maple Blues Awards nominations for the Blues With A Feeling Lifetime Achievement Award and a 2011 Western Canada Music Award Nomination in the Blues Category for Brent Parkin \"Vintage Rhythm\".\nKEN CAMPBELL\nKen Campbell began performing primarily as a guitarist but soon became known for his pedal steel playing. He\u2019s accomplished at mandolin, dobro and bass and along with his wife performs with Portage la Prairie's \"Brennan's Bounty\" formed by former Double Eagle guitarist Charlie Brennan. Campbell performed, toured, and recorded with many bands and artists over the years most notably Heather Bishop, Connie Kaldor, Keith and Renee, and Johnny Dietrich of Portage la Prairie. He now tours regularly with multi-award winning roots artist Ridley Bent whose demo recordings and 2013 CD \u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d were recorded and produced by Campbell at his Glendoro studio. A new CD titled \u201cKiller Tumbleweeds\u201d is being released this April.\u00a0\nJAMIE\u00a0 STEINHOFF\u00a0\nJamie Steinhoff is a bluesman guilty of preserving authenticity. A masterful talent on slide/dobro and fingerstyle/acoustic he presents pre-war and mid-century Delta and Piedmont blues purely and unaltered. Steinhoff shared his clever originals on festival workshop stages with Bill Bourne, Tim Williams, Fred Eaglesmith, Matt Anderson, and Amos Garrett to name a few. Tour highlights include opening for Ramblin' Jack Elliot and sharing a concert bill with John Sebastian in a private Carribean performance.\u00a0He performs and records with duo partner Tracy K releasing a five-star critiqued album \u00a0\"Canned Heat\" in 2011.\u00a0 He also appears on Tracy K\u2019s albums \"Old, New, Borrowed and Blues\" 2007 and \"What\u2019s the Rush?\" 2016. The duo are quarter finalists at the 2014 International Blues Challenge in Memphis Tennessee and most recently completed a Home Routes Tour in Manitoba.\nDARRELL \"SLIDE BOY\" SANDMOEN\nSlide Boy Sandmoen is the official host of the Slide Shows and brings his unique \"down to earth country blues with a twist\" style of slide guitar on electric, acoustic and dobro to the stage. For over the last 45 years Sandmoen developed his deep addiction to slide guitar and loves old style blues of the originators such as Robert Johnson and Hound Dog Taylor and current blues innovators like Ry Cooder, David Lindley and David Wilcox. \u00a0\nHOUSE BAND - The Slide Backers featuring Joanna Miller on drums and Vaughan Poyser on bass.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n",

Tickets are 10 dollars at the door or on eventbrite. Seating is limited to 45. BYOB and Green Kill now offers low-priced refreshments and snacks at it's in-house Ozubar.\nAbout Phil Gammage\n\nPhil Gammage is the consummate live performer, lyricist, singer, guitarist, and harmonica player who brings a unique depth and drama to music, playing original blues/americana. His new album is\u00a0Used Man For Sale.\nhttp://philgammagemusic.com/download_hiresphotos/\nAbout Elly Wininger\n\nThe first time I heard Elly Wininger play guitar, it was in her duo with the folk/blues songwriter Dave Kearny. They traded meaty song after meaty song, from timeless to topical, and with a pretty dazzling command of their traditions: the fine shadings of period, place, idiom and variation. Folk lifers, I thought: playful, knowledgeable and reverent without sanctimony, with none of the affectations of authenticity that often send me scurrying to the bar when the bearded young bards of Brooklyn take the mic and define history as something that ended, for their purposes, in 1963.\nNowhere was the effortless fluency more apparent than in Elly\u2019s nuanced, tricky and deeply rooted guitar-playing. I knew nothing of her story at this point: that she is a 2014 inductee into the New York Blues Hall of Fame; that her guitar teacher was David Bromberg (it shows); that she was offered a recording contract by New York City\u2019s Red Robin Records when she was 16 (her mother refused it); that she was a fixture on the NYC folk scene of her own less-storied generation, a Greenwich Village folk torchbearer and a serious practitioner long after\u00a0Look Magazinehad looked away from that first generation of bearded bards seduced by Delta blues and folk oracle. I just thought, \u201cShit, man, she can play.\u201d\nI\u2019m kind of a genius like that.\nNow I sit with\u00a0Little Red Wagon, Elly Wininger\u2019s lovely, spirited and reflective solo album out now on Rabbit Hole Records. Traditional in instrumentation and in overall sound, and with plenty of rural blues and caf\u00e9 folk reference throughout,\u00a0Little Red Wagonyet delivers a stern warning about doctrinal traditionalism in its lead track. \u201cClarion River\u201d is no folk trope at all, but a jazz-inflected smooth acoustic pop tune in the early-\u201870s mode of Joni and \u2013 especially \u2013 JT. Across the record\u2019s 13 tracks, Wininger defines folk music inclusively and globally, scoffs (implicitly, for Elly is a nice person and does very little explicit scoffing) at retro purism and specious folk/blues identity play. She can go as pure as you want, but she doesn\u2019t really see the point.\nIn fact, at first at least, the rhythm ofLittle Red Wagonis one of an alternation in which non-folk excursions and fusions alternate with returns to home base and bedrock: \u201cClarion River\u201d into the traditional \u201cDown the Line\u201d; the Afro-Cuban, watercolor jazz reminiscence of \u201cThe Girl in the Tree House\u201d into the near-Chicago blues of \u201cShade\u201d (penned by the wildly multifaceted Woodstock musician Kyle Esposito); the almost-show-tune/torch-song \u201cFor Fred\u201d into the Cajun rocker \u201cTwo Steps Forward.\u201d\nWininger does not try to sound hip and world-wearied, and thank God for that. She sounds \u201creal\u201d in a different way. The moment finds her looking back a lot through various musical and lyrical lenses, the confessional and the historical intertwining. But the voice remains a woman in the present: experienced and generous; on the whole positive and keeping the faith, but with plenty of challenges and falters; a little square at times, but she owns that honestly, too. And throughout, of course, everything is brought home again and again by her exquisite guitar-playing and that of co-producer Stephen Miller.\nElly Wininger celebrates the release of\u00a0Little Red Wagonwith a performance at Green Kill in Kingston on Saturday, February 10 at 7 p.m. Green Kill is located at 229 Greenkill Avenue in Kingston.

MILES: Second Annual Acoustic Explosion!Chicago is home to two world renowned acoustic musicians: Eric Lugosch on fingerstyle guitar and Michael J. Miles on clawhammer banjo. Colleagues for decades, they had never played in concert together until last year, when for the first time ever, they delighted a packed house at SPACE with their dazzling musicianship and their entertaining stories. Join us for the second annual event!\nERIC LUGOSCHNational Fingerpicking Champion Eric Lugosch is one of the most inventive fingerstyle guitarists in the world. With annual tours to guitar festivals in Europe and guitar workshops at home and abroad, Eric\u2019s work has been praised by audiences and critics alike. Eric\u2019s musical depth is marked by respect of tradition and uncompromising originality that ranges from American ragtime, blues, gospel and jazz.\n\"Eric strolls into the home turfs of folk, blues, pop and jazz, shepherding contradictory impulses into harmonic bliss like a global peacekeeper\"\u00a0- Justin Hayford, Chicago Reader\n\nWebsite\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Video\nMICHAEL J. MILESMichael J. Miles is one of America\u2019s most innovative clawhammer banjo players. His musical background is steeped in the folk & blues of Chicago, in J.S.

            "text": "BEN HARPER & CHARLIE MUSSELWHITEFacebook | Instagram | Website\"They've made a set that feels timeless and right on schedule.\" -Rolling Stone\"Musselwhite\u2019s dialogue with Harper\u2019s soulful tenor and punchy guitar is pure Astaire and Rogers.\" -BBC MusicAbout the Show:Doors 7:30pm / Show 8:30pmThere\u2019s a moment in the title song of the new Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite album called No Mercy In This Land. A mere few seconds that powerfully capture the friendship and unique collaboration between the two storied musicians. The music, a primal and intimate blues, stops with the exception for a sustained organ note. Musselwhite, survivor and harmonica virtuoso, cohort of Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Little Walter in the early sixties, life nearly ended by alcohol and other maladies, leans in and delivers the lines, \u201cFather left us down here all alone, my poor mother is under a stone. With an aching heart and trembling hands, is there no mercy in this land.\u201d And with those words, that weary voice, you can hear it all - the highs and lows, the adventures, the sadness and all the loss.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI never asked Ben about the lyrics,\u201d Charlie reflects, \u201cbut my mom was a single mom and I was an only child. And the line, \u2018my poor mother is under a stone,\u2019 well, she was murdered. So she's gone and she's under a stone. This is personal to me. It's the essence of blues. People talk about the blues from an academic standpoint, but to me it's about feeling. And that feeling there is pure. That song moves me every time.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ben says the two never discussed the meaning of the lyrics.\u00a0\u201cIt's fragile territory what he went through with his mom,\u201d Ben says. \u201cI was scared to bring that to him, because I know what happened. And that line, it\u2019s me being affected by my friend and what happened to him.\u00a0With Charlie, some things I pick up on are spoken and some are unspoken, but we know a lot about each other. But the deepest part of our friendship doesn't need to be said. \u201cNo Mercy In This Land,\u201d that song is for Charlie. It\u2019s gotta hurt sometimes. I take this shit seriously.\u201dNo Mercy In This Land is a blues record. Charlie Musselwhite and Ben Harper were introduced to one another by John Lee Hooker. The legendary musician thought the two men should play together, so he brought them into the studio to record a song called simply \u201cBurnin' Hell.\u201d The two remained friends and their paths periodically crossed out there on the road. But it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the two met up in a studio to record what would be their Grammy-winning album Get Up!.\u00a0And as good as that record was, it was just the beginning. They both agree that their friendship deepened in the many months of touring that followed. And it\u2019s that bond, that closeness, that makes this new record something special.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat first record happened in the studio,\u201d Charlie says, \u201cBut then we toured together for nearly two years and it just kept getting better and better,\u00a0the musical rapport, the band, the two of us personally. When we finally headed back into the studio we were just charged, ready to go, the songs were jumping out like wild horses ready to run.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEverything I've ever done has had one foot in the blues,\u201d Ben says.\u00a0\u201cThere has never been any doubt in my mind that if Charlie and I are on the planet together, we are going to be making music. The last record kicked the door open, but it was just the beginning. At this moment, I don't think I could make a better record than this. I mean that.\u201dAt first glance, Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite might seem an unlikely pairing. While Ben grew up in in the tree lined Southern California college town of Claremont, a bastion of culture and liberalism just east of Los Angeles, Charlie was raised in Memphis during the time of rockabilly and Sun Records.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while the two might have come to their musical knowledge in different eras and places, as Charlie explains, \u201cWe were both searchers and we\u2019re still seeking.\u201d Each of them possess an enduring hunger for musical knowledge that came to them early.\u00a0Charlie recounts a youth spent scavenging local junk stores for old 78 rpm blues records. \u201cI would discover all this other music too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything that would look interesting, I found all kinds of music that had a feeling that reminded me of the blues. Greek music, Arabic music, Flamenco and Gypsy music.\u00a0I found out that every culture had its music of lament. The songs all have the same kinds of experiences that blues singers talk about.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decades later in Southern California, Ben grew up literally surrounded by music. His grandparents had opened the Folk Music Center in 1958 as a music store and impromptu gathering place for a thriving folk music scene. Artists like Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Doc Watson, John Fahey, The New Lost City Ramblers and others were known to drop by and play.\u00a0Ben\u2019s mother Ellen was a folk singer and his dad Leonard a talented musician as well. Ben worked at the family music store. He learned how to repair and build instruments, became masterful player and gifted songwriter, and eventually a Grammy-winning artist and producer of worldwide acclaim. And just like Charlie, Ben put in hours at local used record stores, scavenging for old blues, hip-hop and punk records. \u201cI was raised around all those crazy instruments and records and people who could play at the highest level,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I'm old enough to have been a record bin diver. And the fact that both Charlie and I were seeking, not only blues, but music with that same emotion and intensity, that is the thread right there.\u201dThe great Willie Dixon called blues, \u201cthe facts of life expressed through words and song.\u201d No Mercy In This Land is that kind of record. It\u2019s the sound of pain and perseverance, it\u2019s a meditative church and a roaring fuzzed out celebration. This is Ben and Charlie\u2019s personal histories, and the sonic story of American struggle and survival.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No Mercy In This Land is a record made by two musicians who have lived. You can hear it in Ben\u2019s singing, which moves from a soulful croon to a cathartic yell. And Charlie\u2019s playing, always a thing of wonder, is absolutely transcendent, his lines dart and weave around the rhythm section with periodic moments of absolute virtuosity. It is a record that exists on the edge, the songs venturing out on to an emotional precipice. You can hear it when they are rocking, and it\u2019s on the ballads, which will break your heart into pieces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie left his Memphis home as a teenager when the local police discovered that he was running moonshine. After years living on the Southside of Chicago soaking up the blues scene, he headed west in the sixties to San Francisco, arriving a suit wearing slicked back hair Robert Mitchum type amidst the summer of flower power and psychedelics. His first show was at the Fillmore opening for Cream. \u201cIt was the stone hippie era, full tilt,\u201d he says. \u201cI never became a hippie, but I really liked them and they liked my music.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the ensuing years Charlie barely survived alcoholism and a subsequent bout of Hep C, yet somehow he managed to outlive most of his esteemed peers while maintaining a career as a working bluesman. \u201cIt\u2019s like the term one-percenter in biker culture,\u201d Charlie says. \u201cTo me blues guys are like the one percenters of the music world. We\u2019ve always been there and been an influence on American music, but it's always been a struggle.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie\u2019s experiences and hard earned wisdom have had an unexpected effect on Ben, as with the track \u201cThe Bottle Wins Again.\u201d Take the lyrics \u201cBroken hearts and broken dreams,\u00a0turns out they weigh the same, passed down through generations, like the family name. There's a gilded coat of arms for those who heal from within, but\u00a0tonight\u00a0the bottle wins again.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean Jesus Christ \u2014 my dad, \u201c Ben says, \u201cThe Christmas\u2019s he would come over and scare my mom out of the house and hold us kids hostage. The shit still haunts me. And the gilded coat of arms for those who can heal from within? Why isn't that me? That's what the song is asking. Some people see the light, some see the dark.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It all came to a head in the studio while they were recording the song. Charlie\u2019s wife Henrieta suddenly spoke up, saying, \u201cThat song was written by an alcoholic.\u201d\u00a0Ben remembers an uncomfortable silence after her words. \u201cWhen she said that, I was so delusional that I thought it was proof that it was a good song,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cI mean look, my dad never got it, but Charlie did. And that\u2019s where this goes beyond friendship for us. He doesn't browbeat you, the man leads by example.\u00a0As much as you reach to music, sometimes it\u2019s reaching to you.\u201d Shortly after recording the song, Ben says he stopped drinking.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last song of the album, \u201cNothing At All,\u201d is a ballad of devastating beauty and emotion. An arrangement of piano, bass and brushed drums conjures the solitude and contemplation of a late night, Ben\u2019s vocals a heart-wrenching soul tinged with unexpected tenderness. Charlie\u2019s playing is absolutely stunning, his phrasing recalling the sweet sad jazz melodies of Chet Baker or Bud Shank. It is harmonica playing like few could imagine let alone accomplish. \u201cHe plays better on this record than he did on the last record,\u201d Ben remarks. \u201cAnd he was already the best harmonica player in the world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No Mercy In This Land is an opportunity to discover Charlie Musselwhite, the slick hoodlum who played Chicago\u2019s Maxwell Street\u00a0with Muddy Waters, Little Walter and Howlin\u2019 Wolf and made the San Francisco scene in the sixties playing the Fillmore. In 1966, he recorded his landmark album Stand Back, later playing on Grammy-winning albums by Bonnie Raitt and the Blind Boys of Alabama, appearing on Tom Waits'\u00a0record Mule Variations, and is now considered one of the most gifted blues musicians working.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s also an opportunity to discover Ben Harper, the unimaginably talented musician, singer and songwriter who produced works by The Blind Boys of Alabama and Rickie Lee Jones. A worldwide star who, given the opportunity to record any album he wanted, chose to collaborate with his friend Charlie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI'm telling you I was born to play with this cat,\u201d Ben says. \u201cAnd I don't say that about anyone else. But I was born to play with Charlie. Writing songs, recording, playing onstage with him, it's the most natural place for my music to land. Whether in the White House or at the Beacon Theater, it's exactly where I'm supposed to be and how I'm supposed to sound, right there in the pocket with Charlie Musselwhite.\u201d",

A mere few seconds that powerfully capture the friendship and unique collaboration between the two storied musicians. The music, a primal and intimate blues, stops with the exception for a sustained organ note. Musselwhite, survivor and harmonica virtuoso, cohort of Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Little Walter in the early sixties, life nearly ended by alcohol and other maladies, leans in and delivers the lines, \u201cFather left us down here all alone, my poor mother is under a stone. With an aching heart and trembling hands, is there no mercy in this land.\u201d And with those words, that weary voice, you can hear it all - the highs and lows, the adventures, the sadness and all the loss.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI never asked Ben about the lyrics,\u201d Charlie reflects, \u201cbut my mom was a single mom and I was an only child. And the line, \u2018my poor mother is under a stone,\u2019 well, she was murdered. So she's gone and she's under a stone. This is personal to me. It's the essence of blues. People talk about the blues from an academic standpoint, but to me it's about feeling. And that feeling there is pure. That song moves me every time.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ben says the two never discussed the meaning of the lyrics.\u00a0\u201cIt's fragile territory what he went through with his mom,\u201d Ben says. \u201cI was scared to bring that to him, because I know what happened. And that line, it\u2019s me being affected by my friend and what happened to him.\u00a0With Charlie, some things I pick up on are spoken and some are unspoken, but we know a lot about each other. But the deepest part of our friendship doesn't need to be said. \u201cNo Mercy In This Land,\u201d that song is for Charlie. It\u2019s gotta hurt sometimes. I take this shit seriously.\u201dNo Mercy In This Land is a blues record. Charlie Musselwhite and Ben Harper were introduced to one another by John Lee Hooker. The legendary musician thought the two men should play together, so he brought them into the studio to record a song called simply \u201cBurnin' Hell.\u201d The two remained friends and their paths periodically crossed out there on the road. But it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the two met up in a studio to record what would be their Grammy-winning album Get Up!.\u00a0And as good as that record was, it was just the beginning. They both agree that their friendship deepened in the many months of touring that followed. And it\u2019s that bond, that closeness, that makes this new record something special.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat first record happened in the studio,\u201d Charlie says, \u201cBut then we toured together for nearly two years and it just kept getting better and better,\u00a0the musical rapport, the band, the two of us personally. When we finally headed back into the studio we were just charged, ready to go, the songs were jumping out like wild horses ready to run.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEverything I've ever done has had one foot in the blues,\u201d Ben says.\u00a0\u201cThere has never been any doubt in my mind that if Charlie and I are on the planet together, we are going to be making music. The last record kicked the door open, but it was just the beginning. At this moment, I don't think I could make a better record than this. I mean that.\u201dAt first glance, Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite might seem an unlikely pairing. While Ben grew up in in the tree lined Southern California college town of Claremont, a bastion of culture and liberalism just east of Los Angeles, Charlie was raised in Memphis during the time of rockabilly and Sun Records.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while the two might have come to their musical knowledge in different eras and places, as Charlie explains, \u201cWe were both searchers and we\u2019re still seeking.\u201d Each of them possess an enduring hunger for musical knowledge that came to them early.\u00a0Charlie recounts a youth spent scavenging local junk stores for old 78 rpm blues records. \u201cI would discover all this other music too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything that would look interesting, I found all kinds of music that had a feeling that reminded me of the blues. Greek music, Arabic music, Flamenco and Gypsy music.\u00a0I found out that every culture had its music of lament. The songs all have the same kinds of experiences that blues singers talk about.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decades later in Southern California, Ben grew up literally surrounded by music. His grandparents had opened the Folk Music Center in 1958 as a music store and impromptu gathering place for a thriving folk music scene. Artists like Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Doc Watson, John Fahey, The New Lost City Ramblers and others were known to drop by and play.\u00a0Ben\u2019s mother Ellen was a folk singer and his dad Leonard a talented musician as well. Ben worked at the family music store. He learned how to repair and build instruments, became masterful player and gifted songwriter, and eventually a Grammy-winning artist and producer of worldwide acclaim. And just like Charlie, Ben put in hours at local used record stores, scavenging for old blues, hip-hop and punk records. \u201cI was raised around all those crazy instruments and records and people who could play at the highest level,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I'm old enough to have been a record bin diver. And the fact that both Charlie and I were seeking, not only blues, but music with that same emotion and intensity, that is the thread right there.\u201dThe great Willie Dixon called blues, \u201cthe facts of life expressed through words and song.\u201d No Mercy In This Land is that kind of record. It\u2019s the sound of pain and perseverance, it\u2019s a meditative church and a roaring fuzzed out celebration. This is Ben and Charlie\u2019s personal histories, and the sonic story of American struggle and survival.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No Mercy In This Land is a record made by two musicians who have lived. You can hear it in Ben\u2019s singing, which moves from a soulful croon to a cathartic yell. And Charlie\u2019s playing, always a thing of wonder, is absolutely transcendent, his lines dart and weave around the rhythm section with periodic moments of absolute virtuosity. It is a record that exists on the edge, the songs venturing out on to an emotional precipice. You can hear it when they are rocking, and it\u2019s on the ballads, which will break your heart into pieces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie left his Memphis home as a teenager when the local police discovered that he was running moonshine. After years living on the Southside of Chicago soaking up the blues scene, he headed west in the sixties to San Francisco, arriving a suit wearing slicked back hair Robert Mitchum type amidst the summer of flower power and psychedelics. His first show was at the Fillmore opening for Cream. \u201cIt was the stone hippie era, full tilt,\u201d he says. \u201cI never became a hippie, but I really liked them and they liked my music.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the ensuing years Charlie barely survived alcoholism and a subsequent bout of Hep C, yet somehow he managed to outlive most of his esteemed peers while maintaining a career as a working bluesman. \u201cIt\u2019s like the term one-percenter in biker culture,\u201d Charlie says. \u201cTo me blues guys are like the one percenters of the music world. We\u2019ve always been there and been an influence on American music, but it's always been a struggle.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie\u2019s experiences and hard earned wisdom have had an unexpected effect on Ben, as with the track \u201cThe Bottle Wins Again.\u201d Take the lyrics \u201cBroken hearts and broken dreams,\u00a0turns out they weigh the same, passed down through generations, like the family name.

And it\u2019s that bond, that closeness, that makes this new record something special.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat first record happened in the studio,\u201d Charlie says, \u201cBut then we toured together for nearly two years and it just kept getting better and better,\u00a0the musical rapport, the band, the two of us personally. When we finally headed back into the studio we were just charged, ready to go, the songs were jumping out like wild horses ready to run.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEverything I've ever done has had one foot in the blues,\u201d Ben says.\u00a0\u201cThere has never been any doubt in my mind that if Charlie and I are on the planet together, we are going to be making music. The last record kicked the door open, but it was just the beginning. At this moment, I don't think I could make a better record than this. I mean that.\u201d<\/P><P>At first glance, Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite might seem an unlikely pairing. While Ben grew up in in the tree lined Southern California college town of Claremont, a bastion of culture and liberalism just east of Los Angeles, Charlie was raised in Memphis during the time of rockabilly and Sun Records.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while the two might have come to their musical knowledge in different eras and places, as Charlie explains, \u201cWe were both searchers and we\u2019re still seeking.\u201d Each of them possess an enduring hunger for musical knowledge that came to them early.\u00a0Charlie recounts a youth spent scavenging local junk stores for old 78 rpm blues records. \u201cI would discover all this other music too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything that would look interesting, I found all kinds of music that had a feeling that reminded me of the blues. Greek music, Arabic music, Flamenco and Gypsy music.\u00a0I found out that every culture had its music of lament. The songs all have the same kinds of experiences that blues singers talk about.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decades later in Southern California, Ben grew up literally surrounded by music. His grandparents had opened the Folk Music Center in 1958 as a music store and impromptu gathering place for a thriving folk music scene. Artists like Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Doc Watson, John Fahey, The New Lost City Ramblers and others were known to drop by and play.\u00a0Ben\u2019s mother Ellen was a folk singer and his dad Leonard a talented musician as well. Ben worked at the family music store. He learned how to repair and build instruments, became masterful player and gifted songwriter, and eventually a Grammy-winning artist and producer of worldwide acclaim. And just like Charlie, Ben put in hours at local used record stores, scavenging for old blues, hip-hop and punk records. \u201cI was raised around all those crazy instruments and records and people who could play at the highest level,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I'm old enough to have been a record bin diver. And the fact that both Charlie and I were seeking, not only blues, but music with that same emotion and intensity, that is the thread right there.\u201d<\/P><P>The great Willie Dixon called blues, \u201cthe facts of life expressed through words and song.\u201d No Mercy In This Land is that kind of record. It\u2019s the sound of pain and perseverance, it\u2019s a meditative church and a roaring fuzzed out celebration. This is Ben and Charlie\u2019s personal histories, and the sonic story of American struggle and survival.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No Mercy In This Land is a record made by two musicians who have lived. You can hear it in Ben\u2019s singing, which moves from a soulful croon to a cathartic yell. And Charlie\u2019s playing, always a thing of wonder, is absolutely transcendent, his lines dart and weave around the rhythm section with periodic moments of absolute virtuosity. It is a record that exists on the edge, the songs venturing out on to an emotional precipice. You can hear it when they are rocking, and it\u2019s on the ballads, which will break your heart into pieces.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie left his Memphis home as a teenager when the local police discovered that he was running moonshine. After years living on the Southside of Chicago soaking up the blues scene, he headed west in the sixties to San Francisco, arriving a suit wearing slicked back hair Robert Mitchum type amidst the summer of flower power and psychedelics. His first show was at the Fillmore opening for Cream. \u201cIt was the stone hippie era, full tilt,\u201d he says. \u201cI never became a hippie, but I really liked them and they liked my music.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the ensuing years Charlie barely survived alcoholism and a subsequent bout of Hep C, yet somehow he managed to outlive most of his esteemed peers while maintaining a career as a working bluesman. \u201cIt\u2019s like the term one-percenter in biker culture,\u201d Charlie says. \u201cTo me blues guys are like the one percenters of the music world. We\u2019ve always been there and been an influence on American music, but it's always been a struggle.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie\u2019s experiences and hard earned wisdom have had an unexpected effect on Ben, as with the track \u201cThe Bottle Wins Again.\u201d Take the lyrics \u201cBroken hearts and broken dreams,\u00a0turns out they weigh the same, passed down through generations, like the family name. There's a gilded coat of arms for those who heal from within, but\u00a0tonight\u00a0the bottle wins again.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean Jesus Christ \u2014 my dad, \u201c Ben says, \u201cThe Christmas\u2019s he would come over and scare my mom out of the house and hold us kids hostage. The shit still haunts me. And the gilded coat of arms for those who can heal from within? Why isn't that me? That's what the song is asking. Some people see the light, some see the dark.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It all came to a head in the studio while they were recording the song. Charlie\u2019s wife Henrieta suddenly spoke up, saying, \u201cThat song was written by an alcoholic.\u201d\u00a0Ben remembers an uncomfortable silence after her words. \u201cWhen she said that, I was so delusional that I thought it was proof that it was a good song,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cI mean look, my dad never got it, but Charlie did. And that\u2019s where this goes beyond friendship for us. He doesn't browbeat you, the man leads by example.\u00a0As much as you reach to music, sometimes it\u2019s reaching to you.\u201d Shortly after recording the song, Ben says he stopped drinking.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last song of the album, \u201cNothing At All,\u201d is a ballad of devastating beauty and emotion. An arrangement of piano, bass and brushed drums conjures the solitude and contemplation of a late night, Ben\u2019s vocals a heart-wrenching soul tinged with unexpected tenderness. Charlie\u2019s playing is absolutely stunning, his phrasing recalling the sweet sad jazz melodies of Chet Baker or Bud Shank. It is harmonica playing like few could imagine let alone accomplish. \u201cHe plays better on this record than he did on the last record,\u201d Ben remarks. \u201cAnd he was already the best harmonica player in the world.\u201d<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No Mercy In This Land is an opportunity to discover Charlie Musselwhite, the slick hoodlum who played Chicago\u2019s Maxwell Street\u00a0with Muddy Waters, Little Walter and Howlin\u2019 Wolf and made the San Francisco scene in the sixties playing the Fillmore. In 1966, he recorded his landmark album Stand Back, later playing on Grammy-winning albums by Bonnie Raitt and the Blind Boys of Alabama, appearing on Tom Waits'\u00a0record Mule Variations, and is now considered one of the most gifted blues musicians working.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s also an opportunity to discover Ben Harper, the unimaginably talented musician, singer and songwriter who produced works by The Blind Boys of Alabama and Rickie Lee Jones. A worldwide star who, given the opportunity to record any album he wanted, chose to collaborate with his friend Charlie.<\/P><P>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI'm telling you I was born to play with this cat,\u201d Ben says. \u201cAnd I don't say that about anyone else. But I was born to play with Charlie. Writing songs, recording, playing onstage with him, it's the most natural place for my music to land. Whether in the White House or at the Beacon Theater, it's exactly where I'm supposed to be and how I'm supposed to sound, right there in the pocket with Charlie Musselwhite.\u201d<\/P>"

The purpose of the bursary is to encourage practitioners to work together, to learn from each other and to seed the development of new ideas that may be made into films in the future. Concepts for film projects in any context or genre will be considered.\n\u00a0To help shape these collaborations Creative Frame in partnership with SLR Film are hosting a panel discussion and workshop for writers and filmmakers based in the three counties in King House Boyle on Friday 27th April. The panel will consist of writers who have successfully worked in film and filmmakers who have collaborated with writers in the development of film projects. Ferdia MacAnna will chair the discussion with writers BrianLeyden and Eoin McNamee and film makers Marian Quinn and Linda Bhreathnach..\n\u00a0Ideally pairings between writers and film makers should be in place before the day as there will be an opportunity in the afternoon to discuss project ideas with the individual panel members, though singletons are welcome and may even find partners on the day! Both filmmakers and writers are invited to use the Creative Frame Forum to find a suitable partner for this project.\n\u00a0Who should attend?\nThis informal and informative session is suitable for writers and film makers based in counties Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon interested in applying for the SLR Film Collaboration Bursary 2018.
