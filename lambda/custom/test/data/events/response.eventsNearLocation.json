We will need 250 donors to set a record, and need your support! The whole process will be filmed and carefully documented in order to meet the strict Guinness Record evidence guidelines.\nWhen\nSaturday, April 21, 2pm-6pm. The official Guinness count will begin at 3 pm sharp. Join us for champagne at Tiffany\u2019s on Michigan Ave at 9am, details here.\n\nWhere\nWe\u2019ve purposefully selected Cloud Gate in Millenium Park because it is well-known as \u201cThe Bean\u201d, a term that\u2019s quite meaningful to those in the transplant community and will be perfect for group photos. British artist Sir Anish Kapoor design of the Bean was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline.\u00a0 What better place to meet than at the world's largest kidney? There are lots of restaurants walking distance from the Bean to dine with your donor friends before or after the event. \nWhy\nApril is National Donate Life Month! Our goal is to bring the living donor community together by creating a unique event that will help raise awareness surrounding the importance of organ donation. Our goal is to connect, support, celebrate, and inspire others to consider living organ donation as an option. Proceeds from ticket sales will start a living organ donor fund for Northwestern Medicine. This fund will be used to help donors at NM with donation expenses not covered by insurance.\nWhat to Wear\nApril in Chicago might mean we get a beautiful sunny day, OR rain showers. Please make sure to prepare for all kinds of weather, as we will be outside for an extended period of time. For the group photo, please wear blue or green (donor colors), OR order a commemorative t-shirt ahead of time. If you would like to purchase a special commemorative t-shirt for the event for $17, please order one here- the shirt will be shipped to you before the event. Proceeds for the t-shirt will benefit the American Living Organ Donor Fund.\u00a0 If you have not ordered a shirt by now, we cannot guarantee it will arrive to you before the event.\nProving You Are A Donor\nTo be counted toward the Guiness Record attempt, you need to be a living organ or tissue donor and complete the following steps.\n1)\u00a0 Buy a ticket on eventbrite, this adds you to the official donor list.\n2)\u00a0 Complete this online form, which will also ask you to upload 2 pages of paperwork.\u00a0 Here is a Youtube video that walks you through the process if you run into problems.\n3)\u00a0 Show up to the event!\u00a0 You will sign a statement in front of a designated witness, and say your name into a camera.\u00a0 We will guide you through this step on event day, it will be fun and interactive!\nSome of our atendees are in the news for attending the rally!\u00a0 Check out their stories here:\nRebecca Marsh's Story\nMike Koetting's Story\nLaurie Lee's Story\n",

As the lines between technology and traditional healthcare continue to blur, our ability to evolve rapidly is more important than ever.\nCan we train our brains to be more comfortable when confronting change and more adept at innovation?\nLeonard Mlodinow, the theoretical physicist and best-selling author of The Drunkard\u2019s Walk and Subliminal, joins us at MATTER to share how healthcare innovators can harness the power of \u201celastic thinking\u201d to thrive in the rapidly changing healthcare landscape. Drawing on cutting-edge research, Leonard\u2019s newest book, Elastic: Flexible Thinking in a Time of Change, examines the psychology and neuroscience of change and explores a cognitive style that Leonard terms elastic thinking: a unique set of talents that include neophilia (an affinity for novelty), schizotypy (a tendency toward unusual perception), imagination and idea generation, and divergent and integrative thinking.\nIn a conversation with his son Alexei Mlodinow, CEO of MATTER company Surgical Innovation Associates, Leonard will share how we can tap into elastic thinking to imagine new possibilities and accelerate innovation in healthcare and beyond.\nAgenda:\n6:00\u20136:30: Networking6:30\u20137:30: Program\n\n\n\nLeonard Mlodinow was born in Chicago, Illinois, received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of California at Berkeley, and is the author of five best-sellers. His book The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules our Lives was named Editor's Choice and Notable Book of the Year, and was short-listed for the Royal Society book award. His book Subliminal won the PEN/Wilson award for literary science writing. His other books include two co-authored with physicist Stephen Hawking \u2014 A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design. In addition to his books and research articles, he has taught at Caltech, written for the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and Forbes magazine, among other publications, and for television series such as MacGyver and Star Trek: the Next Generation.

He moved to Chicago to pursue an MD at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine under full scholarship. During his fourth year, he simultaneously pursued a Kellogg MBA and co-founded Surgical Innovation Associates (SIA) to bring an insight from his clinical mentor from the pages of a patent into the operating room.
