It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.\u00a0\nWho needs to attend?\nThe course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data.\u00a0\nThe following professionals can go for this course:\n1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'\n2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\u00a0\n3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques\n4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data\n7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies\n\nWhat is this course about?\nThe incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc.\u00a0\nHowever, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.\nData science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.\nWhat learning benefits do you get from Trainerkart training?\n\nEstablish a common vocabulary and understanding of basic Project Management terms and concepts such as PMBOK\u00ae, project, Project management, operations, programs, stakeholders, earned value, scheduling techniques, and project managers\u2019 responsibilities and competencies.\nDescribe the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the processes in each of the five Process Groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing\nDefine the 10 Project Management Knowledge areas & the processes in each. Define & explain the relationship of process groups, Knowledge areas, project phases, project &product life cycle\nDemonstrate a clear understanding of what activities, tools, & techniques, are necessary in each phase of a project & understand the PMP\u00ae\u00a0examination nuances\nUnderstand, acknowledge & appreciate importance of risk management.

No longer be ashamed to admit what YOU really want. \n- Get crystal clear in what you want in a partner so you can attract in a match who is 100% of what you want! Not 80%. Not 90%. But 100% in alignment with the real you!\n\nStep 2:\u00a0RELEASE OLD PATTERNS AND DEVELOP A PROCESS TO ALIGN WITH A HIGH-QUALITY MATCH\n- You'll learn how to STEP INTO YOUR POWER and let go of past excuses that have held you back from being who you really are and having what you really want (love) \n- Heal past traumas from prior relationships\u00a0including your parents and past lovers so that your heart is open and available for love\n\nStep 3:\u00a0MASTER THE ATTRACTION PROCESS\n-Boost your self-confidence and love the dating process which will increase the amount of dates you get and quality of dates (no more men just wanting that \u2018one thing\u2019 or ghosting you)\n- The 'F' word - learn the power of forgiveness...which (spoiler alert!) is 100% necessary to happen before you can actually be with your soulmate\n\nStep 4:\u00a0GET READY TO MANIFEST YOUR LOVE\n- Uncover the magic of the universe and learn how to REALLY manifest the desires of your heart instead of being disappointed...again\n- Understand the Law of Attraction (whatever you put out, you get back in return) and how to harness its power to attract to you the perfect match for you\u00a0\n- Get excited about (and create!) a wonderful new life that you don't even recognize filled with love, support and joy!\n\nIt's no secret that my techniques work. Just see what past clients have to say:\u00a0\n\"It took us less than 24 hours to realize we had been calling each other in - we were 100% of what we had been manifesting the past year and more intensely leading up to the end.Fast forward 7 weeks we have not left each other once!!!\u00a0All the times he was manifesting me, I was manifesting him.

We'll take you through the true story of how a language that almost never was grew from a 10-day project at Netscape to the leading language for developing web applications all over the world.\nAbout NodeSchool\nNodeSchool is a friendly way to learn JavaScript and Node.js programming together with other people. If you have a laptop and already know some other programming language, this is a nice way to learn JavaScript and get to know the community. The NodeSchool Chicago chapter gathers together monthly.\nAbout the Venue: WeWork\nWeWork provides small businesses, startups, freelancers, large enterprises, and everyone in between with the workspace, community, and services they need to make a life, not just a living. With weekly events, personalized support, month-to-month flexibility, and access to over 80,000 like-minded creators around the world, WeWork is the perfect place to grow your business. Book your tour here!\nHow does it work?\nThe nodeschool.io website has lists the available Workshoppers - interactive tutorials that you can run in your own pace. The mentors are available for help and chit-chat whenever you need. You can join the event for learning, or just meeting the fellow JavaScripters. We usually work in pairs or small groups of people on a similar skill level - together it is more fun, and you learn better.\nNo previous Node.js experience required - if you already know the basics of JavaScript or any other programming language, you are good to go!\nCall for Students \nInstall Node.js (nodejs.org) and some of the workshoppers (nodeschool.io) before the event. Just in case anything goes wrong, we can help you in the event, or through our Slack.\nIt's also fine to just show up and select your Workshopper on location. If you have any questions, the Chicago Node.js community and the organizers can be reached on #nodeschool on the Chicago Tech slack.\nChicago Tech slack sign-up: www.chicagotechslack.com\nNote: We have a limited number of seats available - in case you cannot attend, please cancel your sign-up on the same page.\nCall for Mentors\nNodeSchool is a largely self-paced way of learning, but without tutors bridging unavoidable gaps a lot of the benefits of the common space is lost. The more tutors we can reach, the more fun it will be\nIf you're interested, please join the #nodeschool channel on the Chicago Tech slack and let us know. \nChicago Tech slack sign-up: www.chicagotechslack.com",
