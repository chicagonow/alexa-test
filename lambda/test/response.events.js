There is no doubt this comes at a high cost to taxpayers, those incarcerated and their families, and society as a whole. With the highest incarceration rates in the world, artists, policymakers, and practitioners have sought to redesign the complex systems and structures that comprise our criminal justice system and fix America\u2019s problem of over incarcerating its residents.<\/P>\n<H3><STRONG>Panelists:<\/STRONG><\/H3>\n<P><SPAN>Moderated by Carroll Bogert\u2013President, The Marshall Project<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><SPAN>Honorable Ruben Castillo\u2013Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois <\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><SPAN>Kim Foxx\u2013State\u2019s Attorney<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><SPAN>Jeff Korzenik\u2013Chief Investment Strategist, Fifth Third Bank<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><SPAN>Toni Preckwinkle\u2013Cook County Board President<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><SPAN>Sarah Ross\u2013Adjunct Assistant Professor, SAIC<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<P><BR><\/P>\n<H4>If you have questions please contact SAIC Events at saicevents@saic.edu\u00a0or\u00a0312.499.4190.\u00a0<\/H4>\n<H4>Persons with disabilities requesting accommodations should visit\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://saic.edu/access\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow\">saic.edu/access<\/A>.<\/H4>\n<H4><SPAN><BR><\/SPAN><\/H4>"

We will need 250 donors to set a record, and need your support! The whole process will be filmed and carefully documented in order to meet the strict Guinness Record evidence guidelines.\nWe will be required to prove to Guinness Records that you are, in fact, a living organ donor. To do that, we will send you an online questionnaire closer to the event date to collect details of your donation. That questionnaire will only be sent to the individuals who sign up on Eventbrite under the category \u201cliving donor.\u201d If you are not a living donor, you can still sign up on Eventbrite, you will see other categories besides living donor to select your status.\nWhen\nSaturday, April 21, 2pm-6pm. The official Guinness count will begin at 3 pm sharp. Follow signage from the Bean, and have your ID ready! \nWhere\nWe\u2019ve purposefully selected Cloud Gate in Millenium Park because it is well-known as \u201cThe Bean\u201d, a term that\u2019s quite meaningful to those in the transplant community and will be perfect for group photos. British artist Sir Anish Kapoor design of the Bean was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline.\u00a0 What better place to meet than at the world's largest kidney? There are lots of restaurants walking distance from the Bean to dine with your donor friends before or after the event. \nWhy\nApril is National Donate Life Month! Our goal is to bring the living donor community together by creating a unique event that will help raise awareness surrounding the importance of organ donation. Our goal is to connect, support, celebrate, and inspire others to consider living organ donation as an option. Proceeds from ticket sales will start a living organ donor fund for Northwestern Medicine. This fund will be used to help donors at NM with donation expenses not covered by insurance.\nWhat to Wear\nApril in Chicago might mean we get a beautiful sunny day, OR rain showers. Please make sure to prepare for all kinds of weather, as we will be outside for an extended period of time. For the group photo, please wear blue or green (donor colors), OR order a commemorative t-shirt ahead of time. If you would like to purchase a special commemorative t-shirt for the event for $17, please order one here- the shirt will be shipped to you before the event. Proceeds for the t-shirt will benefit the American Living Organ Donor Fund.\nProving You Are A Donor\nTo be counted toward the Guiness Record attempt, you need to be a living organ or tissue donor and complete the following steps.\n1)\u00a0 Buy a ticket on eventbrite, this adds you to the official donor list.\n2)\u00a0 Complete this online form, which will also ask you to upload 2 pages of paperwork.\n3)\u00a0 Show up to the event!\u00a0 You will sign a statement in front of a designated witness, and say your name into a camera.\u00a0 We will guide you through this step on event day, it will be fun and interactive!\nAdditional Information\nStay tuned as we\u2019ll share more details as the event draws near.
